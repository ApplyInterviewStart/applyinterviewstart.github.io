    <h2>Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy</h2>

    <p style="margin-top:12px; max-width:75ch; font-size:1.5rem; line-height:1.7;">
      ApplyInterviewStart provides time-based and custom professional services. Because of the nature of this work,
      refunds are handled according to the guidelines below.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Career Consults &amp; Interview Prep (Scheduled Sessions)</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:12px; max-width:75ch; font-size:1.5rem; line-height:1.7;">
      Full refunds are available if you cancel at least <strong>24 hours</strong> before the scheduled session.
      Missed sessions or cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled time are generally not refundable.
      If an emergency arises, contact us — we may offer a one-time reschedule at our discretion.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Resume &amp; CV Writing</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:12px; max-width:75ch; font-size:1.5rem; line-height:1.7;">
      If you request a refund before work has begun, you may receive a full refund.
      Once work has started, refunds are generally not available because this service involves custom work.
      If you’re dissatisfied, please reach out — we may offer reasonable revisions or other good-faith accommodations when appropriate.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:18px;">Free Career Assessment</h3>
    <p style="margin-top:12px; max-width:75ch; font-size:1.5rem; line-height:1.7;">
      The Free Career Assessment is free and therefore not eligible for refunds.
